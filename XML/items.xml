			Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2•8-. A luminous gemstone with exquisite optical properties and electromagnetic conductivity.
		</desc>
		<pda>
			Found exclusively around certain thermal vents, these exotic crystals, despite having a similar gross molecular structure to common quartz, have electron distributions more commonly seen in metallic elements.
			
			This material can only form under very particular circumstances, specifically where superheated, mineral-rich water is injected into cold water, in the absence of dense flora which would absorb, or fast currents which would disperse, the minerals before they can recrystallize. During this recrystallization process, many of the material's electrons are temporarily trapped within the crystal structure in a higher energy state.
			
			The light emitted by these deposits originates from those electrons the crystal structure dropping back into the ground state, releasing a photon in the process. While they remain energized, these electrons imbue the crystal structure with both high electrical and magnetic conductivity, allowing it to channel and reflect fields of the same.
			
			This arrangement also makes the crystal fairly unstable; Careless handling can result in violent fracturing, which destroys the aforementioned structure and releases a large quantity of energy.

		<desc>
			Pt. A dense, valuable, rare metal with extreme resistance to corrosion. In addition to being useful for creating alloys, it is also useful as a chemical catalyst with organic compounds.
		</desc>
		<pda>
			Rarer and more valuable even than gold, platinum is a transition metal whose chief property is its extremely low chemical reactivity. This makes it all but impervious to corrosion, and allows it to mediate many chemical reactions without being consumed itself. In particular it is well-suited to rearranging the components of organic molecules.
			
			The extreme rarity of this metal can be partly attributed to its high density; during planetary formation and meteoric bombardment, it sinks to the core, leaving only traces in the crust. What little is left further settles to the lowest layers of the sediment, only becoming available via excavation or other disturbances to said sediment.

			Abyssoclase
		</name>
		<desc>
			Small, dense crystals formed under extreme pressure, with trace amounts of exotic elements such as Tellurium.
		</desc>
		<pda>
			In the deepest layers of the open ocean, where mineral-rich water expelled from thermal vents collects due to its greater density relative to ordinary seawater, the extreme pressure can force these minerals back out of solution.
			
			Abyssoclase is one such mineral, formed when a small seed crystal - possibly quartz, diamond, or sulfur - is coated with successive layers of silcia deposits rich in Tellurium and other rare elements.
			
			These deposits, due to the nature of the environment in which they form, are extremely dense, hard, and resistant to compressive forces. If integrated into another substrate, they can massively increase that material's mechanical strength.

			Avolite is an extremely rare crystal with extraordinary physical properties, the underlying mechanisms of which are very poorly understood, to the point where in eras past its properties would have been ascribed to theological origins and perhaps even formed the basis of primitive religions.
			
			This mineral demonstrates behavior analogous to the piezoelectric effect, except on a far larger scale, dragging spacetime itself as it warps when subjected to electromagnetic fields.
			
			This ability to manipulate space and time makes these crystals an integral part of both interstellar propulsion systems and phase gates, and as a result Avolite is one of the most prized minerals in existence.

			The main body of the plant is comprised of a fibrous tube filled with a strongly alkaline gel. The primary purpose of this may be to deter creatures from eating the stems, or it may help the conduction of the plant's biochemical processes.
			
			This plant possesses an unusual ability to detect disturbances in the water nearby, and will retract into the seabed for protection when approached by potential predators. Avoiding such detection will be necessary to allow samples to be taken.

		<pda>
			Deepvine differs substantially in appearance from its shallow-water counterpart, but genetic analysis reveals a close relationship. Like creepvine, it acts as both food and shelter for the local population of small fauna, supporting an ecosystem more rich in biomass than would typically be possible at this depth.
			
			Unlike normal creepvine, however, deepvine has evolved to depend on chemosynthesis based on minerals ejected by nearby geothermal activity in the lieu of sunlight. This is accomplished by the leaves harboring extensive colonies of several species of bacteria which can perform biochemical reactions at far greater rate and efficiency than would be possible without them.

			Pyropod Pitcher
		</name>
		<desc>
			Plant pods containing a complex mix of biological compounds, encased in a tough fibrous shell capable of withstanding high temperatures.
		</desc>
		<pda>
			Like several other apparent species on 4546B, pyropods are in fact two distinct organisms, but - unusually for species encountered thus far - this relationship is not in fact symbiotic, but instead unquestionably parasitic. The host plant's most notable characteristic is the hard vaselike structure it forms around itself; this is perhaps an attempt at armoring itself against the parasite, though it is quite ineffective if this is in fact its purpose.
			
			The other plant takes the form of several glowing pods, each containing a noxious soup of chemicals. When attached to the host plant, the parasite consumes its leaves and injects these compounds into the host plant, triggering rapid chemical breakdown of its internal structures into nutrients which the parasite can then consume. The resultant reaction heats the interior of the base to the point of measurably raising the surrounding water temperature.

			The purpose of the bioluminescent features on the stalker may be to aid this intimidation, or they may be designed to attract small prey fish.
